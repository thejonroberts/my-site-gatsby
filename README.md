This is the repo for my personal website.

I used React/[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and it is being hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It was very easy to get up and running, and I don't have to worry about managing a server, certificates, etc... Highly recommended if you are interested.

May get a blog going here.
